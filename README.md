# CER-PEX
 A collection of Practical Exercise for the Course Computational Engineering and Robotics at Technical University Darmstadt

Practical Exercise 1: Implementing the Computations of forward and inverse Kinematics in order to controll a robot hand with two joints.

Practical Exercise 2: Implementing the Computations of various Integration methods, in order to compare the effects and qualities of each method on our Simulation.

Practical Exercise 3: Implementing the PID-Controller, in order to account the effect of external errors like gravity and frictions.
